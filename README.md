# SIMPLE-CHATBOT

## Project Overview

This project is part of the RISE Internship â€“ Python Programming Projects. It demonstrates how to create a simple chatbot using Python dictionaries and if-else logic. The chatbot can answer basic queries related to Tamizhan Skills courses and provides predefined responses to the user.

Chatbots are becoming common in customer service, education, and online platforms. By building this simple chatbot, beginners can understand the fundamentals of how conversational agents work and how AI assistants can be simulated using basic programming concepts.

## Problem Statement

Students often want to learn about AI but feel that it is too complex. This project solves that by showing how a chatbot can be built without advanced libraries. The chatbot uses a rule-based approach, meaning it only responds based on predefined rules and keywords.

## Objectives

To design a basic chatbot in Python.

To allow students to interact with the chatbot using text input.

To provide responses to common queries about courses, fees, timings, and contact information.

To introduce beginners to the concept of logic building and simple AI assistants.

## Requirements

Python 3.13.6 installed on your system.

No extra libraries required.


## Features

Greets users with a welcome message.

Responds to keywords such as hello, hi, courses, fees, contact, bye.

Uses a dictionary to map keywords to responses.

Keeps running in a loop until the user types bye, exit, or quit.

Provides a default response if the input is not recognized.


## How to Run

### 1. Save the Script

Save the Python code as:

simple_chatbot.py

### 2. Run the Chatbot

Open a terminal or command prompt and type:

python simple_chatbot.py


## Learning Outcomes

Learned how to create a rule-based chatbot.

Practiced Python dictionaries and loops.

Understood how logic building works in simple AI systems.

Gained experience with user input handling in Python.


## Future Enhancements

Add more questions and responses.

Use fuzzy matching to handle typos.

Integrate the chatbot into a website or mobile app.

Extend with Natural Language Processing (NLP) for smarter answers.
